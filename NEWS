perfgrind 0.4
* Allow to use software performance events (if requested from command line)
* C++11 compiler is required now for building perfgrind

perfgrind 0.3

* Allow to set arbitrary frequency in pgcollect via -F argument.
* Handling of hits in PLT added.
* Properly handle page offset in mmap events.

perfgrind 0.2

* New completely rewritten converter pgconvert, old pgreport is removed.
* Flat/callgraph profiles are supported.
* Different levels of details are supported: object, symbol, source.
* Instruction dumping is supported.
* Resulting 'callgrind' files are much smaller now, thanks to grouping hits
  by object/symbol/source file/source line.
* pginfo utility for getting some stats about dump file.

perfgrind 0.1

* Inital release.
* pgcollect records samples for PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES events in userspace
  only at frequency 1000. Attaching to existing process and spawning new process
  are supported.
* pgreport converts collected samples to 'callgrind' format. Only callgraphs are
  supported, detalization is always 'source file/line' (when debug information
  is available), instruction dumping is not implemented.
