Short and incomplete TODO list:

- handle overlapping memory objects.

- use debug link section in ELF for finding separate debug info.

- detect correct call from addresses. Currently we put cumulative count to
  instruction next after call.

- create several profiles from collected data. If we collect samples by forking
  new process, we have to enable inherit mode. This means that we will get
  samles not only forked process, but from its children as well. We will need
  to add PERF_SAMPLE_TID to sample_type and change .pgdata format.

- perform namespace compression during dumping.
